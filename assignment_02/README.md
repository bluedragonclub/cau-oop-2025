# Assignment #02


- In this assignment, we aim to implement some functionalities for vectors in 3-dimensional(3D) space.

- The submission deadline is <span style="color:red">**October 14, 2024 at 23:59**</span>. 

- All declarations such as function prototypes, structures, etc should be written in **"vector3d.h"** header file, and function definitions (i.e., function bodies) should be written in **"vector3d.cpp"** source file.

- In the evaluation system, the file names, "vector3d.h" and "vector3d.cpp", are used, thus your submission will <span style="color:red">**NOT**</span> be recognized by the system <span style="color:red">**if you change the file names**</span>.

- Submit the two files, "vector3d.h" and "vector3d.cpp", to the BDC system. <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> include a file that contains **main** function.

- You **CANNOT** use the C++ standard library unless the headers are explicitly specified. You can include `<cmath>` header in "vector3d.cpp" to use `sqrt`, `pow`, `fabs`, `acos`, and etc.

- Collaborate with your colleagues to write and share test cases in `main` function. <span style="color:red">**However, any plagiarism is not allowed.**</span> Plagiarism will be checked by automatic methods in the system.


- Your files and codes might look like:


    ```C++
    // vector3d.h
    #pragma once

    double vector3d_len(Vector3d v);
    Vector3d vector3d_add(Vector3d v1, double c);

    // omitted...
    ```

    ```C++
    // vector3d.cpp
    #include "vector3d.h"

    double vector3d_len(Vector3d v)
    {
        // Implement the function...
    }

    Vector3d vector3d_add(Vector3d v1, double c)
    {
    // Implement the function...
    }
    
    // omitted...
    ```

    ```C++
    // DO NOT submit a source file that includes main() function.
    // Use main() function only for your tests.
    #include "vector3d.h"

    int main()
    {
        // Write some test cases for verifying your codes...

        return 0;
    }
    ```

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "vector3d.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {

    const int n = 7;
    Vector3d arr[n] = {
        { 5.0, 0.0, 0.0 }, // 0
        { 0.0, 5.0, 0.0 }, // 1
        { 0.0, 0.0, 5.0 }, // 2
        { 5.0, 5.0, 0.0 }, // 3
        { 5.0, 5.0, 5.0 }, // 4
        { 5.0, 5.0, 0.0 }, // 5
        { 0.0, 0.0, 5.0 }, // 6
    };

    Vector3d v = { 5.1, 5.0, 0.0 };

    // The idx_nearest should be 3, not 5.
    auto idx_nearest = vector3d_nearest(v, arr, n);

    // The idx_farthest should be 2.
    auto idx_farthest = vector3d_farthest(v, arr, n);

    // The min distance be 0.
    auto dist_min = vector3d_min_distance(arr, n);

    // The max distance be sqrt(25 + 25 + 25) = 8.66025403...
    auto dist_max = vector3d_max_distance(arr, n);

    cout << "idx_nearest: " << idx_nearest << endl;
    cout << "idx_farthest: " << idx_farthest << endl;
    cout << "dist_min: " << dist_min << endl;
    cout << "dist_max: " << dist_max << endl;

}
```
