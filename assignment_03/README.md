# Assignment #03

- In this assignment, we aim to rewrite the `Vector3d` structure as a C++ class.

- The submission deadline is <span style="color:red">**October 22, 2025 at 23:59**</span>.

- All declarations such as function prototypes, structures, classes, etc should be written in **"Vector3d.h"** header file, and function definitions (i.e., function bodies) should be written in **"Vector3d.cpp"** source file. Note that the first characters of the file names are capitalized.

- In the evaluation system, the file names, "Vector3d.h" and "Vector3d.cpp", are used, thus your submission will <span style="color:red">**NOT**</span> be recognized by the system <span style="color:red">**if you change the file names**</span>.
- Submit the two files, "Vector3d.h" and "Vector3d.cpp", to the codePost system. <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> include a file that contains **main** function.

- You **CANNOT** use the C++ standard library unless the headers are explicitly specified. You can include `<cmath>` header in "Vector3d.cpp" to use `sqrt`, `pow`, `fabs`, `acos`, and etc.

- Collaborate with your colleagues to write and share test cases in `main` function. <span style="color:red">**However, any plagiarism is not allowed.**</span> Plagiarism will be checked by automatic methods in the system.

- Write a class for vectors in 3-dimensional space. This class is almost the same as the `Vector3d` structure in the [Assignment#02](https://github.com/bluedragonclub/cau-oop-2023/tree/main/assignment_02).

- Your files and codes might look like:

  ```C++
  // Vector3d.h
  #pragma once

  class Vector3d
  {
  private:
      double mX;
      double mY;
      double mZ;

  public:
      Vector3d();
      Vector3d(double x, double y, double z);

      double GetX() const;
      double GetY() const;
      double GetZ() const;

      void SetX(double x);
      void SetY(double y);
      void SetZ(double z);

      Vector3d Add(double c) const;
      Vector3d Add(const Vector3d& v) const;
      Vector3d Sub(double c) const;
      Vector3d Sub(const Vector3d& v) const;
      Vector3d Mul(double c) const;
      Vector3d Mul(const Vector3d& v) const;
      Vector3d Div(double c) const;
      Vector3d Div(const Vector3d& v) const;

      double Sum() const;
      double Length() const;
      double Distance(const Vector3d& v) const;
      double Inner(const Vector3d& v) const;
      Vector3d Cross(const Vector3d& v) const;
      double Angle(const Vector3d& v, bool radian = true) const;
  };

  ```

  ```C++
  // Vector3d.cpp
  #include <cmath>
  #include <cfloat>

  #include "Vector3d.h"

  using namespace std;

  const double pi = std::acos(-1);

  Vector3d::Vector3d()
  {
      // Implement the constructor...
  }

  // omitted...

  Vector3d Vector3d::Add(double c) const
  {
      // Implement the member function...
  }

  Vector3d Vector3d::Add(const Vector3d& v2) const
  {
      // Implement the member function...
  }

  Vector3d Vector3d::Sub(double c) const
  {
      // Implement the member function...
  }

  // omitted...
  ```

  ```C++
  // DO NOT submit a source file that includes main() function.
  // Use main() function only for your tests.
  #include "Vector3d.h"

  int main()
  {
      // Write some test cases for verifying your codes...

      return 0;
  }
  ```

## Problem (1)

Write the constructors, getters, and setters of `Vector3d`. The default constructor should initialize all member variables to zero. [30pts]

```C++
Vector3d();
Vector3d(double x, double y, double z);
double GetX() const;
double GetY() const;
double GetZ() const;
void SetX(double x);
void SetY(double y);
void SetZ(double z);
```

## Problem (2)

Write the following member functions of `Vector3d` class. All operations are element-wise operations. These functions should **NOT** change the elements of the callee object. These member functions should return a new `Vector3d` instance after their calculations. [40pts]

```C++
Vector3d Add(double c) const;
Vector3d Add(const Vector3d& v2) const;
Vector3d Sub(double c) const;
Vector3d Sub(const Vector3d& v2) const;
Vector3d Mul(double c) const;
Vector3d Mul(const Vector3d& v2) const;
Vector3d Div(double c) const;
Vector3d Div(const Vector3d& v2) const;
```

The following example shows how `vector3d_add` function in [Assignment#02](https://github.com/bluedragonclub/cau-oop-2023/tree/main/assignment_02) corresponds to `Vector3d::Add` member function.

```C++
// The members of v1 and v2 should NOT be changed.
auto v3 = v1.Add(c);   // auto v3 = vector3d_add(v1, c);
auto v3 = v1.Add(v2);  // auto v3 = vector3d_add(v1, v2);
```

## Problem (3)

Write the `sum` member function of `Vector3d` class for the summation of all elements in `Vector3d`. [5pts]

```C++
double Sum() const;
```

$$
v = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) \rightarrow Sum(v) = 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 6.0
$$

## Problem (4)

Write the following member functions of `Vector3d` class. You can refer to the [Assignment#02](https://github.com/bluedragonclub/cau-oop-2023/tree/main/assignment_02) for more details. [25pts]

```C++
double Length() const;
double Distance(const Vector3d& v2) const;
double Inner(const Vector3d& v2) const;
Vector3d Cross(const Vector3d& v2) const;
double Angle(const Vector3d& v2, bool radian = true) const;
```
